Hi Vlad,

I'd like to talk about broken __build__.
It has been failing since your last commit. I understand that you are working part-time on the project and full with tasks. But may i ask you to fix it as soon as possible? Looking forward could you please check your commits more attentively? Build issues may cause project complication and interfere development process.
Please revert your changes as soon as possible and commit them back after full check. We'll highly appreciate that.
Let me know if you need any help.

Thank you for understanding,
 Alexander.
