__Subject:__ Progress on inner template.

Hi Vlad, 

I'd like you to be aware of my progress on inner-page template.

Main page and whole-page templates are done already and being succsesfully checked on a test domain. As well as mobile responsive desing on a whole project.

Inner-page template is still in progress, and here i've faced a couple of issues:
* There are difficulty with merging databases.
* Current view module does not provide responsive layout in a box.

So i need to make a research on this issues now and find a workaround. It wil slow my workflow on a project amd i'm afraid i will not be able to finish on time. Are you okay with that?

I understand that this can affect on a release date so i'm ready to discuss and work out possible solutions of this problem. Please let me know the most suitable way for you.

Kind regards,
Alexander
