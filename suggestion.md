__Subject:__ New framework usage.
Hi Vlad,

I would like to discuss with you the possibility of a __Apache Hadoop__ usage.
Now we have a couple of issues with a big-data analysis:
* It takes a plenty of time to make a _data report_.
* Increased costs due to the involvement of third-party specialists.
* Potential mistakes in the future.

___
  
__Apache Hadoop__  is a collection of open-source software utilities that facilitate using a network of many computers to solve problems involving massive amounts of data and computation.
It provides a software framework for distributed storage and processing of big data using the MapReduce programming model.

Usage of this framework will give as a lot of benefits:
* Cost reduction.
* Commercial support.
* Tasks and jobs trackers.
* Easy production product placement __etc.__

Moreover, __Apache Hadoop__ is a open-source software. This will provide community support, __supplier independence__ and full documentation.

That would be a good experience to use this Framework.
We'll be definitely at an advantage.

Best Regards, Alexander.
