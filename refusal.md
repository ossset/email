___Subject:___ Re: New functionality.

Hi Vlad,

I've investigated thoroughly the improvement you proposed. I agree that it will make user experience better. And in general it will be a very good enhancement of the application. 
But this feature was not verified yet, i'm afraid it will cause this iteration dedline date delay. Our prior goal is to implement core functionality with the schedule.
I'm afraid that implementing this feature now will be an interference.
What do you this about placing it after first iteration?

Best regards,
 Alexander.
